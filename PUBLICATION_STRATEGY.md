# Adv-EARS Publication Strategy

## Executive Summary

The adv-ears project is a TypeScript-based formal requirements language tool that requires multi-format distribution to serve different user segments effectively. This comprehensive publication strategy outlines the approach for distributing adv-ears as:

- **NPM Library Package**: For developers integrating AEARS parsing and UML generation into their applications
- **VSCode Extension**: For requirements engineers and analysts using AEARS syntax in their daily workflow
- **CLI Tool**: For automation, CI/CD integration, and command-line users

### Strategic Goals
- **Unified Codebase**: Maintain single source of truth with multiple entry points
- **Synchronized Releases**: Ensure version consistency across all distribution channels
- **Quality Assurance**: Implement comprehensive validation before each release
- **Automated Distribution**: Minimize manual intervention in release processes
- **Security First**: Protect credentials and implement secure publishing workflows

### Success Metrics
- Zero-downtime releases across all channels
- <5 minute release cycle from tag to availability
- 100% test coverage for release-critical paths
- Automated rollback capability within 2 minutes

## Release Strategy Overview

### Multi-Format Distribution Approach

The project employs a **monolithic architecture with multiple entry points** strategy:

```
adv-ears/
├── src/
│   ├── index.ts          # NPM library entry point
│   ├── cli/cli.ts        # CLI tool entry point
│   ├── lib/              # Core library functionality
│   ├── lsp/              # Language Server Protocol
│   └── types/            # Shared TypeScript definitions
├── package.json          # NPM package configuration
├── extension.json        # VSCode extension manifest (to be created)
└── dist/                 # Compiled output for all targets
```

### Synchronized Versioning Strategy

- **Single Version Source**: [`package.json`](package.json:3) version field drives all releases
- **Semantic Versioning**: Strict adherence to semver (currently at 0.1.0)
- **Tag-Driven Releases**: Git tags trigger automated release workflows
- **Changelog Automation**: Generate release notes from conventional commits

### Quality Gates and Validation Process

All releases must pass through sequential quality gates:

1. **Code Quality Gate**: Linting, formatting, type checking
2. **Test Validation Gate**: Unit, integration, and contract tests
3. **Build Verification Gate**: Successful compilation for all targets
4. **Security Scanning Gate**: Dependency vulnerability checks
5. **Package Validation Gate**: Verify package contents and metadata

```

## CI/CD Pipeline Strategy

### Automated Validation Processes

The existing [`pr-validation.yml`](.github/workflows/pr-validation.yml:1) workflow provides the foundation for release validation:

```yaml
# Enhanced validation pipeline
- Code Quality: ESLint, Prettier, TypeScript compilation
- Testing: Unit, integration, contract tests via npm run check
- Build Verification: Clean build process
- Security Scanning: Dependency vulnerability assessment
```

### Release Automation Workflow

Enhanced [`release.yml`](.github/workflows/release.yml:1) workflow includes:

#### Current Implementation
- Node.js 22 setup with NPM registry configuration
- Dependency installation including VSCode extension tools
- TypeScript compilation and VSCode extension packaging
- GitHub release creation with VSIX artifacts
- NPM and VSCode Marketplace publishing

#### Required Enhancements
```yaml
# Additional steps needed
- name: Security Scan
  run: npm audit --audit-level high

- name: Bundle Analysis
  run: npm run analyze-bundle

- name: CLI Testing
  run: |
    npm run build
    ./dist/cli/cli.js --version
    ./dist/cli/cli.js validate test-syntax.aears

- name: Library API Testing
  run: npm run test:api-contract

- name: Rollback Preparation
  run: |
    echo "PREVIOUS_VERSION=$(npm view adv-ears version)" >> $GITHUB_ENV
    echo "ROLLBACK_READY=true" >> $GITHUB_ENV
```

### Multi-Registry Publishing Approach

#### NPM Registry

- **Authentication**: `VSCE_PAT` (Personal Access Token)
- **Publisher**: To be configured
- **Categories**: Programming Languages, Other

#### GitHub Packages (Optional)
- **Target**: GitHub Package Registry
- **Authentication**: `GITHUB_TOKEN`
- **Scope**: `@amir-arad/adv-ears`
- **Purpose**: Backup distribution channel

## Security and Credentials Management

### Token and Secret Management

#### Required Secrets
```bash
# GitHub Repository Secrets
NPM_TOKEN=npm_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx          # NPM publishing
VSCE_PAT=vsce_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx          # VSCode Marketplace

## Quality Assurance Framework

### Testing Requirements for Releases

#### Test Categories and Coverage
Based on existing test structure in [`tests/`](tests/):

1. **Unit Tests** ([`tests/unit/`](tests/unit/)): 90% code coverage minimum
   - Parser functionality
   - AST generation
   - UML generation

2. **Integration Tests** ([`tests/integration/`](tests/integration/)): End-to-end workflows
   - LSP server functionality
   - System integration
   - UML generation pipeline

3. **Contract Tests** ([`tests/contract/`](tests/contract/)): API contract validation
   - Library API compliance
   - CLI interface stability
   - LSP protocol adherence

4. **Module Tests** ([`tests/modules/`](tests/modules/)): Feature-specific validation
   - CLI command validation
   - Error handling
   - Extension functionality

#### Release-Specific Testing
```bash
# Pre-release test suite
npm run test:all                    # All existing tests
npm run test:cli-integration        # CLI tool functionality
npm run test:library-api           # Library API contracts
npm run test:vscode-extension      # Extension functionality
npm run test:performance           # Performance benchmarks
```

### Performance Validation

#### Benchmarks and Thresholds
- **Parse Time**: <100ms for 1000-line AEARS files
- **UML Generation**: <500ms for complex diagrams
- **CLI Startup**: <200ms cold start
- **Library Import**: <50ms module load time
- **Memory Usage**: <50MB for typical operations

#### Performance Testing Pipeline
```bash
# Automated performance testing
npm run benchmark:parser
npm run benchmark:uml-generation
npm run benchmark:cli-performance
npm run benchmark:memory-usage
```

### Compatibility Checking

#### Node.js Compatibility
- **Minimum Version**: Node.js 22.0.0 (as specified in [`package.json`](package.json:49))
- **Testing Matrix**: Test against Node.js 22.x, 23.x

## Rollback and Incident Response

### Emergency Rollback Procedures

#### NPM Package Rollback
```bash
# Immediate rollback steps
npm unpublish adv-ears@<problematic-version>  # Within 72 hours only
npm deprecate adv-ears@<problematic-version> "Critical issue - use previous version"

# Alternative: Publish fixed version
npm version patch
npm publish
```

#### VSCode Extension Rollback
```bash
# Extension rollback (requires marketplace support)
vsce unpublish adv-ears <problematic-version>
# Or publish fixed version immediately
vsce publish patch
```

#### GitHub Release Rollback
```bash
# Mark release as pre-release
gh release edit v<version> --prerelease
# Or delete release entirely
gh release delete v<version>
```

### Incident Escalation Process

#### Severity Levels
1. **Critical (P0)**: Security vulnerabilities, data loss, complete service failure
2. **High (P1)**: Major functionality broken, significant user impact
3. **Medium (P2)**: Minor functionality issues, workarounds available
4. **Low (P3)**: Cosmetic issues, documentation errors

#### Response Timeline
- **P0**: Immediate response, rollback within 30 minutes
- **P1**: Response within 2 hours, fix within 24 hours
- **P2**: Response within 24 hours, fix within 1 week
- **P3**: Response within 1 week, fix in next regular release

### Recovery Strategies

#### Automated Recovery
```yaml
# GitHub Actions workflow for automated rollback
name: Emergency Rollback
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      version:
        description: 'Version to rollback to'
        required: true
      reason:
        description: 'Rollback reason'
        required: true

jobs:
  rollback:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Rollback NPM
        run: npm deprecate adv-ears@latest "${{ github.event.inputs.reason }}"
      
      - name: Notify Team
        run: |
          curl -X POST ${{ secrets.SLACK_WEBHOOK }} \
            -d "{'text':'🚨 Emergency rollback initiated: ${{ github.event.inputs.reason }}'}"
```

#### Manual Recovery Procedures
1. **Assess Impact**: Determine scope and severity
2. **Communicate**: Notify users via GitHub issues, NPM deprecation message
3. **Rollback**: Execute appropriate rollback procedure
4. **Investigate**: Root cause analysis
5. **Fix**: Develop and test fix
